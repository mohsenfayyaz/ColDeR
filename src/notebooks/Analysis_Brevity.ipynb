      "The film premiered at the 23rd Cannes Film Festival and was released theatrically in the United States on December 10 , 1969 . \" Two Doors Down \" was a song written and performed by Dolly Parton , which provided a 1978 U.S. country and pop hit for her . The song was sung from the perspective of a woman who has just broken up with her boyfriend and is debating attending a party two doors down the hall from her apartment . She decides to go , meets a new man and returns with him to her own apartment \" two doors down \" . It was included on Parton 's 1977 Here You Come Again album , but before Parton could release it as the album 's second single in March 1978 , singer Zella Lehr released a cover version that became a top ten U.S. country hit . While Lehr 's version was on the country charts , the title cut of Here You Come Again was becoming a much bigger pop hit than Parton had anticipated . Wanting to capitalize on her newfound pop success ( and also not wanting to compete with Lehr 's country version of the song ) Parton rerecorded a more loose , pop - oriented version of \" Two Doors Down \" with a slight disco flavoring . She released the new version on a double - A - sided single , with the other side , \" It 's All Wrong , but It 's All Right \" intended for country airplay , and \" Two Doors Down \" intended for the pop airplay . The single topped the U.S. country charts , and was a top-20 pop hit for Parton , and went on to be one of her most popular hits . Also in 1978 Joe Thomas did his own disco cover of this song . Parton also had the new version of \" Two Doors Down \" ( which omitted the first verse , and included an upbeat \" sing - along \" bridge ) replace the previous version on all subsequent pressings of Here You Come Again , making the earlier version something of a collectors ' item among Parton 's fans . The original version of \" Two Doors Down \" was subsequently issued on CD in 2000 on the 3-CD Australian compilation Legendary Dolly Parton , which is now out of print . In 2009 , Jill Johnson recorded the song on the cover album Music Row II .\n"

The album features guest vocals by band 's former vocalist Dimitri Minakakis ( on \" Fix Your Face \" ) and Mastodon 's Brent Hinds ( on \" Horse Hunter \" ) .</td>\n",

The novel is presented in the form of diary entries maintained on a PowerBook by the narrator , Daniel .

       "      <td>Chachalacas are galliform birds from the genus Ortalis .  These birds are found in wooded habitats in far southern United States ( Texas ) , Mexico , and Central and South America . They are social , can be very noisy and often remain fairly common even near humans , as their relatively small size makes them less desirable to hunters than their larger relatives . As invasive pests , they have a ravenous appetite for tomatoes , melons , beans , and radishes and can ravage a small garden in short order . They travel in packs of six to twelve . They somewhat resemble the guans , and the two have commonly been placed in a subfamily together , though the chachalacas are probably closer to the curassows . The generic name is derived from the Greek word όρταλις , meaning \" pullet \" or \" domestic hen . \" The common name is an onomatopoeia for the four - noted cackle of the plain chachalaca ( O. vetula ) . Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data tentatively suggest that the chachalacas emerged as a distinct lineage during the Oligocene , somewhere around 40–20 mya , possibly being the first lineage of modern cracids to evolve ; this does agree with the known fossil record – including indeterminate , cracid - like birds – which very cautiously favors a north - to - south expansion of the family .</td>\n",

       "3903  In 2009 , Jill Johnson recorded the song on the cover album Music Row II . \" Two Doors Down \" was a song written and performed by Dolly Parton , which provided a 1978 U.S. country and pop hit for her . The song was sung from the perspective of a woman who has just broken up with her boyfriend and is debating attending a party two doors down the hall from her apartment . She decides to go , meets a new man and returns with him to her own apartment \" two doors down \" .

Zarir ( also spelled Zarih ) was a Sasanian prince who was the leader of a rebellion in northern Iran in 485 . According to Armenian historian Ghazar Parpetsi , who is the only source about the life of Zarir , the latter was a son of the Sasanian shah Yazdegerd II .  After the death of Peroz I ( who had succeeded his father as king ) , Balash was elected as king by the nobility and clergy . Zarir , dissatisfied with the election , rebelled . Balash was thus forced to make peace with his enemy Vahan Mamikonian and sent him at the head of an army to suppress the rebellion of Zarir . Zarir was shortly defeated , and fled to the mountains , but was quickly captured and \" shot down like an animal \" .   \n",

The album is Gil Sharone 's first and last album with the band and their first without founding drummer Chris Pennie . Lead guitarist Ben Weinman plays guitar alone on the record , due to Brian Benoit 's injury . The album incorporates influences from electronic music . According to an interview in Terrorizer magazine , this is their last album on the Relapse Records label . The album was critically successful , debuting on the Billboard 200 at number 142 with 7,000 copies scanned , but was later corrected when it was revealed that Relapse somehow forgot to scan the pre - release album sales , which made the first week total actually around 11,000 . The album features guest vocals by band 's former vocalist Dimitri Minakakis ( on \" Fix Your Face \" ) and Mastodon 's Brent Hinds ( on \" Horse Hunter \" ) .   \n",

Zarir ( also spelled Zarih ) was a Sasanian prince who was the leader of a rebellion in northern Iran in 485 . According to Armenian historian Ghazar Parpetsi , who is the only source about the life of Zarir , the latter was a son of the Sasanian shah Yazdegerd II .  After the death of Peroz I ( who had succeeded his father as king ) , Balash was elected as king by the nobility and clergy . Zarir , dissatisfied with the election , rebelled . Balash was thus forced to make peace with his enemy Vahan Mamikonian and sent him at the head of an army to suppress the rebellion of Zarir .

According to the Bible , Medan ( \" contention ; to twist , conflict \" ) ; also spelt Madan was the third son of Abraham , the patriarch of the Israelites , and Keturah whom he we d after the death of Sarah .  Josephus tells us that \" Abraham contrived to settle them in colonies ; and they took possession of Troglodytis and the country of Arabia Felix ( Arabia the Happy ) , as far as it reaches to the Red Sea . \" Abraham , in all probability , tried to keep them apart from Isaac to avoid conflict while fulfilling God 's commission to spread out and inhabit the globe . Little else is known about him . There is no known connection to the Madan people of Iran and Iraq .   \n",

It first appeared in short story form as the cover article for the January 1994 issue of Wired magazine and was subsequently expanded to full novel length . Set in the early 1990s , it captures the state of the technology industry before Windows 95 , and anticipates the dot - com bubble of the late 1990s . The novel is presented in the form of diary entries maintained on a PowerBook by the narrator , Daniel . Because of this , as well as its formatting and usage of emoticons , this novel is similar to what emerged a decade later as the blog format . Coupland revisited many of the ideas in Microserfs in his 2006 novel JPod , which has been labeled \" Microserfs for the Google generation \" .   \n",

It first appeared in short story form as the cover article for the January 1994 issue of Wired magazine and was subsequently expanded to full novel length . Set in the early 1990s , it captures the state of the technology industry before Windows 95 , and anticipates the dot - com bubble of the late 1990s . The novel is presented in the form of diary entries maintained on a PowerBook by the narrator , Daniel . Because of this , as well as its formatting and usage of emoticons , this novel is similar to what emerged a decade later as the blog format . Coupland revisited many of the ideas in Microserfs in his 2006 novel JPod , which has been labeled \" Microserfs for the Google generation \" .   \n",

The lake and park have a fishing dock , wading pool , tennis courts , and softball diamonds . There is a recreation center that hosts activities . The lake borders a municipal golf course . In the winter the park sets up ice and hockey rinks . There is a bike and walking path starting at Lake Hiawatha which veers onto Lake Nokomis or winds down the Minnehaha Creek right to the mouth of the Minnehaha Falls .

These birds are found in wooded habitats in far southern United States ( Texas ) , Mexico , and Central and South America . They are social , can be very noisy and often remain fairly common even near humans , as their relatively small size makes them less desirable to hunters than their larger relatives . As invasive pests , they have a ravenous appetite for tomatoes , melons , beans , and radishes and can ravage a small garden in short order . They travel in packs of six to twelve . They somewhat resemble the guans , and the two have commonly been placed in a subfamily together , though the chachalacas are probably closer to the curassows . The generic name is derived from the Greek word όρταλις , meaning \" pullet \" or \" domestic hen . \" The common name is an onomatopoeia for the four - noted cackle of the plain chachalaca ( O. vetula ) . Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data tentatively suggest that the chachalacas emerged as a distinct lineage during the Oligocene , somewhere around 40–20 mya , possibly being the first lineage of modern cracids to evolve ; this does agree with the known fossil record – including indeterminate , cracid - like birds – which very cautiously favors a north - to - south expansion of the family .   \n",

And much like those songs , replaced sacred lyrics with secular blues lyrics with doo - wop call and response harmonies . The song was the B - side to Charles ' number - one R&B ; single , \" A Fool for You \" , and was a charted hit on its own , peaking at number nine on the chart . The tune was re - made to top 40 pop status in 1958 by The Everly Brothers .    \n",

Mauritius was a constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth as head of state . The Queen was also the monarch of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms . Her constitutional roles in Mauritius were delegated to a Governor - General . The Parliament of the United Kingdom 's Mauritius Independence Act 1968 transformed the British Crown Colony of Mauritius into an independent sovereign state . Unusually , no member of the British royal family attended the independence ceremony on the island because of security concerns . Princess Alexandra was due to attend but after communal violence the British Minister of State for the Commonwealth , Lord Shepherd , advised that her visit be cancelled . The Queen and her husband Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , visited Mauritius for three days ( 24–26 March ) in 1972 , as part of a tour of Asia and Africa . They arrived in Port Louis on the royal yacht Britannia after visiting the Seychelles . They were met by a crowd of nearly a quarter of a million people , and rode through the city in an open - topped car . During the visit , the Queen opened the sixth session of the third Mauritius Parliament . The royal couple left Mauritius for Nairobi by air . It was the first ever visit to the island by a reigning monarch . Mauritius became a republic within the Commonwealth in 1992 with the President of Mauritius replacing the Queen as head of state . To date , Mauritius is the most recent of the Queen 's realms to become a republic .   \n",
