Across the Black Waters is an English novel by the Indian writer Mulk Raj Anand first published in 1939 . It describes the experience of Lalu , a sepoy in the Indian Army fighting on behalf of Britain against the Germans in France during World War I. He is portrayed by the author as an innocent peasant whose poor family was evicted from their land and who only vaguely understands what the war is about . The book has been described as Anand 's best work since the Untouchable . In Lalu 's tragedy lied the tragedy of the Indian village and Anand dramatizes a poignant truth : to disposses any one of land is to deny him an identity .— Basavaraj Naikar The book is part of a trilogy ( along with The Village and The Sword and the Sickle ) that chronicles the life of Lalu as he struggles to rise from the bottom of Indian society . In the background is India 's fight for independence . This book is the only Indian English novel that is set in World War I and portrays the experiences of Lalu , who only wants to reclaim the piece of land his family lost as a reward for serving . But when he returns from war , he finds his family destroyed and his parents dead . The novel 's larger themes are that of war and death Lalu encounters Western culture .</td>\n",

Across the Black Waters is an English novel by the Indian writer Mulk Raj Anand first published in 1939 . It describes the experience of Lalu , a sepoy in the Indian Army fighting on behalf of Britain against the Germans in France during World War I. He is portrayed by the author as an innocent peasant whose poor family was evicted from their land and who only vaguely understands what the war is about . The book has been described as Anand 's best work since the Untouchable . In Lalu 's tragedy lied the tragedy of the Indian village and Anand dramatizes a poignant truth : to disposses any one of land is to deny him an identity .— Basavaraj Naikar The book is part of a trilogy ( along with The Village and The Sword and the Sickle ) that chronicles the life of Lalu as he struggles to rise from the bottom of Indian society . In the background is India 's fight for independence . This book is the only Indian English novel that is set in World War I and portrays the experiences of Lalu , who only wants to reclaim the piece of land his family lost as a reward for serving . But when he returns from war , he finds his family destroyed and his parents dead . The novel 's larger themes are that of war and death Lalu encounters Western culture .</td>\n",

       "2401  New Orleans Baby Cakes The New Orleans Baby Cakes ( formerly the Zephyrs ) are a Minor League Baseball team based in Metairie , Louisiana , a suburb of New Orleans . The Baby Cakes play in the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) and are the Triple - A affiliate of the Miami Marlins . The Baby Cakes play their home games at Shrine on Airline . The team joined the PCL after the 1997 season when the American Association ( AA ) was disbanded . They were one of five clubs from the AA to join the PCL , with three joining the International League . Triple - A baseball was also expanded to 30 teams at that time , concurrent with the expansion of Major League Baseball . The Baby Cakes franchise history spans more than 110 years , three cities , five leagues , and affiliations with 14 of the present 30 Major League teams , some on more than one occasion . Both the organization 's formation and geographic moves were in response to franchise movements on the major league level . The team plans to relocate to Wichita , Kansas , as early as 2020 , pending the approval of professional baseball . The city hopes to bring in a Double - A Southern League team to replace the Baby Cakes .   \n",

       "2401  The New Orleans Baby Cakes ( formerly the Zephyrs ) are a Minor League Baseball team based in Metairie , Louisiana , a suburb of New Orleans . The Baby Cakes play in the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) and are the Triple - A affiliate of the Miami Marlins . The Baby Cakes play their home games at Shrine on Airline . The team joined the PCL after the 1997 season when the American Association ( AA ) was disbanded . They were one of five clubs from the AA to join the PCL , with three joining the International League . Triple - A baseball was also expanded to 30 teams at that time , concurrent with the expansion of Major League Baseball . The Baby Cakes franchise history spans more than 110 years , three cities , five leagues , and affiliations with 14 of the present 30 Major League teams , some on more than one occasion . Both the organization 's formation and geographic moves were in response to franchise movements on the major league level . The team plans to relocate to Wichita , Kansas , as early as 2020 , pending the approval of professional baseball . The city hopes to bring in a Double - A Southern League team to replace the Baby Cakes .   \n",

On older maps , the islands are called Stora Hessingen and Lilla Hessingen . The islands were a part of the administrative Bromma Parish until 1916 , when they were incorporated with the parish into Stockholm Municipality . They remained a part of Bromma ecclesiastical parish until 1955 , when they received their own parish within the Church of Sweden . A bridge was built between the islands and Kungsholmen in 1907 , and between the islands themselves in 1917 . In 1966 , the Essingeleden motorway opened across the islands . The Alviksbron bridge ( for pedestrians , bicycles , and trams ) opened in 2000 .   \n",

       "2401  George Thomas Nostrand ( January 25 , 1924 – November 8 , 1981 ) was an American professional basketball player . A 6'8 \" ( 2.03 m ) forward / center from High Point University ( 1941 – 1944 ) and the University of Wyoming ( 1944 – 1945 ) , Nostrand played four seasons ( 1946–1950 ) in the National Basketball Association as a member of the Toronto Huskies , Cleveland Rebels , Providence Steamrollers , Boston Celtics , Tri - Cities Blackhawks , and Chicago Stags . He averaged 8.2 points per game in his professional career . Nostrand is perhaps best known for appearing in a series of Canadian newspaper advertisements to promote the first National Basketball Association game , a November 1 , 1946 contest between Nostrand 's Toronto Huskies and the New York Knicks . The advertisements promised that anyone taller than Nostrand would receive free admission to the opening game .   \n",

On older maps , the islands are called Stora Hessingen and Lilla Hessingen . The islands were a part of the administrative Bromma Parish until 1916 , when they were incorporated with the parish into Stockholm Municipality . They remained a part of Bromma ecclesiastical parish until 1955 , when they received their own parish within the Church of Sweden . A bridge was built between the islands and Kungsholmen in 1907 , and between the islands themselves in 1917 . In 1966 , the Essingeleden motorway opened across the islands .

The islands were a part of the administrative Bromma Parish until 1916 , when they were incorporated with the parish into Stockholm Municipality . They remained a part of Bromma ecclesiastical parish until 1955 , when they received their own parish within the Church of Sweden . A bridge was built between the islands and Kungsholmen in 1907 , and between the islands themselves in 1917 . In 1966 , the Essingeleden motorway opened across the islands .

Edmund Burke (; 12 January [ NS ] 17309 July 1797 ) was an Irish statesman born in Dublin , as well as an author , orator , political theorist and philosopher , who after moving to London in 1750 served as a member of parliament ( MP ) between 1766 and 1794 in the House of Commons with the Whig Party . Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state .  Burke criticized British treatment of the American colonies , including through its taxation policies . He also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority , though he opposed the attempt to achieve independence . Burke is remembered for his support for Catholic emancipation , the impeachment of Warren Hastings from the East India Company and for his staunch opposition to the French Revolution . In his Reflections on the Revolution in France , Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of good society , traditional institutions of state and society and condemned the persecution of the Catholic Church that resulted from it . This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the Whig Party , which he dubbed the \" Old Whigs \" , as opposed to the pro - French Revolution \" New Whigs \" , led by Charles James Fox . In the nineteenth century , Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals . Subsequently , in the twentieth century he became widely regarded as the philosophical founder of modern conservatism .</td>\n",

New Haven Harbor is an inlet on the north side of Long Island Sound in the state of Connecticut in the United States . The harbor area is an inlet carved by the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age approximately 13,000 years ago . The city of New Haven and its neighborhoods of City Point , Long Wharf , The Annex , and East Shore lie on the northern and eastern sides . West Haven is on the west . The Quinnipiac and Mill rivers converge and empty into the inlet on its north end . The Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge crosses here . The West River empties into the western end of the harbor ( also known as West Haven Harbor ) . The harbor is protected from Long Island Sound by a peninsula on its eastern side , once known as \" Little Necke \" but now called Lighthouse Point , because of the lighthouse that was constructed on its tip in 1805 . The original lighthouse was replaced in 1845 by the current structure , called the Five Mile Point Lighthouse .  Sperry Lighthouse ( 1899 – 1933 ) also served the harbor . In July 1779 , during the American Revolutionary War , the peninsula was the scene of an amphibious landing by British troops .

The game is presented in a horizontal side - view environment and has ranging gravitational pulls for each planet , which subjects Jetman 's craft to various forms of inertia . Similar to its predecessors , Jetman must keep his craft topped up with fuel in order to progress through levels . The game was developed mostly by Mancunian developer Zippo Games under the name of Iota before being ordered to change the game into a Jetman title by Rare . Ports of the game for the ZX Spectrum , Commodore 64 and Atari ST were completed but not released due to poor sales of the NES version . The game received mostly positive reviews upon release , with critics praising the game 's presentation and graphics , however criticism was directed at the game 's difficulty .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Isaac Watts is an equally recognized nonconformist minister whose hymns are still sung by Christians worldwide . In English church history , a nonconformist was a Protestant who did not \" conform \" to the governance and usages of the established Church of England . Broad use of the term was precipitated after the Restoration of the British monarchy in 1660 , when the Act of Uniformity 1662 re - established the opponents of reform within the Church of England . By the late 19th century the term specifically included the Reformed Christians ( Presbyterians , Congregationalists and other Calvinist sects ) , plus the Baptists and Methodists . The English Dissenters such as the Puritans who violated the Act of Uniformity 1559—typically by practising radical , sometimes separatist , dissent — were retrospectively labelled as nonconformists . By law and social custom , nonconformists were restricted from many spheres of public life — not least , from access to public office , civil service careers , or degrees at university — and were referred to as suffering from civil disabilities . In England and Wales in the late 19th century the new terms \" free churchman \" and \" Free Church \" started to replace \" dissenter \" or \" Nonconformist \" . One influential nonconformist minister was Matthew Henry , who beginning in 1710 published his multi - volume Commentary that is still used and available in the 21st century .</td>\n",

It describes the experience of Lalu , a sepoy in the Indian Army fighting on behalf of Britain against the Germans in France during World War I. He is portrayed by the author as an innocent peasant whose poor family was evicted from their land and who only vaguely understands what the war is about .  In Lalu 's tragedy lied the tragedy of the Indian village and Anand dramatizes a poignant truth : to disposses any one of land is to deny him an identity .— Basavaraj Naikar The book is part of a trilogy ( along with The Village and The Sword and the Sickle ) that chronicles the life of Lalu as he struggles to rise from the bottom of Indian society . In the background is India 's fight for independence . This book is the only Indian English novel that is set in World War I and portrays the experiences of Lalu , who only wants to reclaim the piece of land his family lost as a reward for serving . But when he returns from war , he finds his family destroyed and his parents dead . The novel 's larger themes are that of war and death Lalu encounters Western culture .</td>\n",

Panlongcheng ( ) or Panlong City is an archaeological site associated with the Erligang culture .  Panlongcheng is the largest excavated Erligang site ( 1   km² at its peak ) , showing the southernmost reach of the Erligang culture at its peak . It was discovered in 1954 , and excavated in 1974 and 1976 . The site at Panlongcheng was sparsely inhabited during the Erlitou period , consisting mainly of several small settlements and occupying an area of around 200,000 m² . During the early Erligang period , the site suddenly grew rapidly , reaching an area of around with a walled center of 75,000 m² . Panlongcheng may have been an Erligang outpost used to control regional resources , such as copper mines . The construction and bronze casting techniques at Panlongcheng are identical with the techniques employed at Erligang and Zhengzhou ; however , the pottery style is different . The style of Erligang elite burials is almost an exact replica of the burials at Zhengzhou ; however , later layers show that the Erligang style disappeared during the later stages of the Erligang culture . The site declined until it was abandoned altogether at the end of the Erligang culture . Panlongcheng 's decline may have been affected in part by the growth of the site at Wucheng .

The first official National Football League ( NFL ) playoff game was the 1933 NFL Championship Game between the Chicago Bears and New York Giants . A \" playoff \" game was played in 1932 between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans to break a regular season tie , but is recorded in the team record books as a regular season game . Since then there have been a total over 525 NFL playoff games including games from the AFL , but not the AAFC . The following list shows career postseason records for each starting quarterback in the NFL playoffs . Wins or losses are credited to the quarterback who started the game for each team , even if he was injured or failed to complete the game . While many players have won playoff games for two teams , only two have won a championship for different franchises .  Peyton Manning was the quarterback for 2006 Colts and the 2015 Broncos . Note : from 1933–1949 some offenses did not employ a quarterback in the modern sense of the position . Listed below are the \" primary passers \" for those games , the players that passed the ball most in those games . They may not have actually started the game at quarterback . This format allows Hall of Fame quarterbacks like Sid Luckman and Sammy Baugh to maintain credit for their team 's playoff records since they were obviously the top passer for their team .

Most of the humour in the episode relies on religious satire .  Edmund , faced with the threat of assassination , attempts to escape to France into self - imposed exile ; and in a later scene , two drunk knights overhear King Richard IV exclaiming \" Who will rid me of this turbulent priest ? \" , the words attributed to King Henry II which led to Becket 's death in 1170 , and embark on a mission to murder Edmund . \" The Archbishop \" won an International Emmy Award in 1983 in the Popular Arts category .

       "6237  These views were expressed in his A Vindication of Natural Society . Edmund Burke (; 12 January [ NS ] 17309 July 1797 ) was an Irish statesman born in Dublin , as well as an author , orator , political theorist and philosopher , who after moving to London in 1750 served as a member of parliament ( MP ) between 1766 and 1794 in the House of Commons with the Whig Party . Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state .  Burke criticized British treatment of the American colonies , including through its taxation policies . He also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority , though he opposed the attempt to achieve independence . Burke is remembered for his support for Catholic emancipation , the impeachment of Warren Hastings from the East India Company and for his staunch opposition to the French Revolution . In his Reflections on the Revolution in France , Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of good society , traditional institutions of state and society and condemned the persecution of the Catholic Church that resulted from it . This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the Whig Party , which he dubbed the \" Old Whigs \" , as opposed to the pro - French Revolution \" New Whigs \" , led by Charles James Fox . In the nineteenth century , Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals . Subsequently , in the twentieth century he became widely regarded as the philosophical founder of modern conservatism .   \n",

New Haven Harbor is an inlet on the north side of Long Island Sound in the state of Connecticut in the United States . The harbor area is an inlet carved by the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age approximately 13,000 years ago . The city of New Haven and its neighborhoods of City Point , Long Wharf , The Annex , and East Shore lie on the northern and eastern sides . West Haven is on the west . The Quinnipiac and Mill rivers converge and empty into the inlet on its north end . The Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge crosses here . The West River empties into the western end of the harbor ( also known as West Haven Harbor ) . The harbor is protected from Long Island Sound by a peninsula on its eastern side , once known as \" Little Necke \" but now called Lighthouse Point , because of the lighthouse that was constructed on its tip in 1805 . The original lighthouse was replaced in 1845 by the current structure , called the Five Mile Point Lighthouse .  Sperry Lighthouse ( 1899 – 1933 ) also served the harbor . In July 1779 , during the American Revolutionary War , the peninsula was the scene of an amphibious landing by British troops . The harbor is circumnavigable via the partially completed \" Harborside Greenway \" bicycle and pedestrian trail , which is part of the East Coast Greenway system .   \n",

The Foix ( ) is a river in Catalonia in the province of Barcelona , northeastern Spain .  Later it runs through the Comarca of Alt Penedès , where it feeds a reservoir in the nature reserve of Parc del Foix since 1928 , which is highly important for the drinking water supply of the densely populated coastal plain between Barcelona and Tarragona . Then it goes through the Comarca of Garraf from north to the south where it ends into the Mediterranean Sea west of the village of Cubelles . This little delta became an important natural reserve and recreational area after the campground ″Camping Paradiso″ was removed in the late 1990s . For most of the year , the river is dried up because of the dam and because of hot - summer climatical reasons . That can suddenly change in the winter months when heavy rain comes down in the mountains .   \n",

Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship is a multi - directional shooter video game developed by Zippo Games and Rare and published by Tradewest . It was released in North America on 14 October 1990 and in Europe on 26 September 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System . The game is the third instalment of the Jetman series and was later re - released by Nintendo for their NES - based PlayChoice-10 arcade system in the United States in 1990 . In the game , series protagonist Jetman must manoeuvre his small craft through caverns of various planets whilst searching for pieces of the Golden Warpship . The game is presented in a horizontal side - view environment and has ranging gravitational pulls for each planet , which subjects Jetman 's craft to various forms of inertia . Similar to its predecessors , Jetman must keep his craft topped up with fuel in order to progress through levels . The game was developed mostly by Mancunian developer Zippo Games under the name of Iota before being ordered to change the game into a Jetman title by Rare . Ports of the game for the ZX Spectrum , Commodore 64 and Atari ST were completed but not released due to poor sales of the NES version . The game received mostly positive reviews upon release , with critics praising the game 's presentation and graphics , however criticism was directed at the game 's difficulty .    \n",

In English church history , a nonconformist was a Protestant who did not \" conform \" to the governance and usages of the established Church of England . Broad use of the term was precipitated after the Restoration of the British monarchy in 1660 , when the Act of Uniformity 1662 re - established the opponents of reform within the Church of England . By the late 19th century the term specifically included the Reformed Christians ( Presbyterians , Congregationalists and other Calvinist sects ) , plus the Baptists and Methodists . The English Dissenters such as the Puritans who violated the Act of Uniformity 1559—typically by practising radical , sometimes separatist , dissent — were retrospectively labelled as nonconformists . By law and social custom , nonconformists were restricted from many spheres of public life — not least , from access to public office , civil service careers , or degrees at university — and were referred to as suffering from civil disabilities . In England and Wales in the late 19th century the new terms \" free churchman \" and \" Free Church \" started to replace \" dissenter \" or \" Nonconformist \" . One influential nonconformist minister was Matthew Henry , who beginning in 1710 published his multi - volume Commentary that is still used and available in the 21st century .    \n",

Across the Black Waters is an English novel by the Indian writer Mulk Raj Anand first published in 1939 . It describes the experience of Lalu , a sepoy in the Indian Army fighting on behalf of Britain against the Germans in France during World War I. He is portrayed by the author as an innocent peasant whose poor family was evicted from their land and who only vaguely understands what the war is about .  In Lalu 's tragedy lied the tragedy of the Indian village and Anand dramatizes a poignant truth : to disposses any one of land is to deny him an identity .— Basavaraj Naikar The book is part of a trilogy ( along with The Village and The Sword and the Sickle ) that chronicles the life of Lalu as he struggles to rise from the bottom of Indian society . In the background is India 's fight for independence . This book is the only Indian English novel that is set in World War I and portrays the experiences of Lalu , who only wants to reclaim the piece of land his family lost as a reward for serving . But when he returns from war , he finds his family destroyed and his parents dead . The novel 's larger themes are that of war and death Lalu encounters Western culture .   \n",

Zarir ( also spelled Zarih ) was a Sasanian prince who was the leader of a rebellion in northern Iran in 485 . According to Armenian historian Ghazar Parpetsi , who is the only source about the life of Zarir , the latter was a son of the Sasanian shah Yazdegerd II .  After the death of Peroz I ( who had succeeded his father as king ) , Balash was elected as king by the nobility and clergy . Zarir , dissatisfied with the election , rebelled . Balash was thus forced to make peace with his enemy Vahan Mamikonian and sent him at the head of an army to suppress the rebellion of Zarir . Zarir was shortly defeated , and fled to the mountains , but was quickly captured and \" shot down like an animal \" .   \n",

He was the leading native administrator / collaborator with the Lancastrian regime in France . As its position weakened , his own fortunes and even personal safety became precarious . Although the city of Rouen did not fall to Charles VII of France until late 1449 , well after Luxembourg 's death , Henry VI 's government had long ago decided he needed and deserved remuneration and status based more securely in England . Thus he was provided to Ely ' in commendam ' on 27 September 1437 . This was the fifth wealthiest see in England , yet also amongst the smallest in terms of size or burden . He is not known ever to have visited it . He died on 18 September 1443 .   \n",

Panlongcheng ( ) or Panlong City is an archaeological site associated with the Erligang culture .  Panlongcheng is the largest excavated Erligang site ( 1   km² at its peak ) , showing the southernmost reach of the Erligang culture at its peak . It was discovered in 1954 , and excavated in 1974 and 1976 . The site at Panlongcheng was sparsely inhabited during the Erlitou period , consisting mainly of several small settlements and occupying an area of around 200,000 m² . During the early Erligang period , the site suddenly grew rapidly , reaching an area of around with a walled center of 75,000 m² . Panlongcheng may have been an Erligang outpost used to control regional resources , such as copper mines . The construction and bronze casting techniques at Panlongcheng are identical with the techniques employed at Erligang and Zhengzhou ; however , the pottery style is different . The style of Erligang elite burials is almost an exact replica of the burials at Zhengzhou ; however , later layers show that the Erligang style disappeared during the later stages of the Erligang culture . The site declined until it was abandoned altogether at the end of the Erligang culture . Panlongcheng 's decline may have been affected in part by the growth of the site at Wucheng . In Hubei Province , other sites such as Jingnansi and Baimiaozhu also feature Erlitou or Late Erlitou – Early Erligang type of ceramics .   \n",

The lead track on the single is \" My Red Hot Car ( Girl ) \" , which leaves the pop music aspects of the song intact . An extended version of \" My Red Hot Car \" is featured on the album Go Plastic . My Red Hot Car is notable for two different hidden tracks , based on format : the CD version features an ambient piece after 23 minutes of silence , while the vinyl features a percussion - less version of \" I Wish You Obelisk \" presented behind a silent , locked groove , meaning the needle must be lifted halfway through the second side and placed after the locked groove in order to hear it . The single was selected as NME Single of the Week in its week of release .   \n",

The first official National Football League ( NFL ) playoff game was the 1933 NFL Championship Game between the Chicago Bears and New York Giants . A \" playoff \" game was played in 1932 between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans to break a regular season tie , but is recorded in the team record books as a regular season game . Since then there have been a total over 525 NFL playoff games including games from the AFL , but not the AAFC . The following list shows career postseason records for each starting quarterback in the NFL playoffs . Wins or losses are credited to the quarterback who started the game for each team , even if he was injured or failed to complete the game . While many players have won playoff games for two teams , only two have won a championship for different franchises .  Peyton Manning was the quarterback for 2006 Colts and the 2015 Broncos . Note : from 1933–1949 some offenses did not employ a quarterback in the modern sense of the position . Listed below are the \" primary passers \" for those games , the players that passed the ball most in those games . They may not have actually started the game at quarterback . This format allows Hall of Fame quarterbacks like Sid Luckman and Sammy Baugh to maintain credit for their team 's playoff records since they were obviously the top passer for their team .

It is set in England in the late 15th century , and follows the exploits of the fictitious Prince Edmund as he is invested as Archbishop of Canterbury amid a Machiavellian plot by the King to acquire lands from the Catholic Church . Most of the humour in the episode relies on religious satire .  Edmund , faced with the threat of assassination , attempts to escape to France into self - imposed exile ; and in a later scene , two drunk knights overhear King Richard IV exclaiming \" Who will rid me of this turbulent priest ? \" , the words attributed to King Henry II which led to Becket 's death in 1170 , and embark on a mission to murder Edmund . \" The Archbishop \" won an International Emmy Award in 1983 in the Popular Arts category . The Catholic Church was to be satirized again in the second series , Blackadder II , in the 1986 episode \" Money \" .   \n",
