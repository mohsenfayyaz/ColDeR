    "# BEIR: A Heterogenous benchmark for Zero-shot Evaluation of Information Retrieval models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains an simple and easy examples to evaluate retrieval models from our new benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The BEIR benchmark contains 9 diverse retrieval tasks including 17 diverse datasets. We evaluate 9 state-of-the-art retriever models all in a zero-shot evaluation setup. Today, in this colab notebook, we first will show how to download and load the 14 open-sourced datasets with just three lines of code. Afterward, we would load some state-of-the-art dense retrievers (bi-encoders) such as SBERT, ANCE, DPR models and use them for retrieval and evaluate them in a zero-shot setup.\n",

    "Don't hesitate to send us an e-mail or report an issue, if something is broken (and it shouldn't be) or if you have further questions.\n",
