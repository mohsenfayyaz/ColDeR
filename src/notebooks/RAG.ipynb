The river has its source in Zimbabwe , some south of Harare , then flows south and then east , from the Zimbabwean highveld to its confluence with the Odzi River . It then turns south , drops over the Chivirira ( “ Place of Boiling ” ) Falls , and flows down the western side of Zimbabwe 's Eastern Highlands forming a dry river valley in the rain shadow of these mountains . It is joined by the Runde River or Lundi at the Mozambique border , forming a dramatic confluence at Mahenya . It then crosses Mozambique to flow into the Indian Ocean at about 21 ° S. The Save River provided irrigation for sugar plantation , but now supports the cultivation of citrus , cotton , rice , and wheat . It is also a source of small - scale fishing for the local population . It divides Mozambique administratively , politically , ethnically and ecologically : During the colonial era , the whole area south of the Save was considered a province of Mozambique ; presently , the Save separates the provinces of Gaza and Inhambane to the south , from those of Manica and Sofala to the north : Politically , the “ south - of - the - Save ” can be considered the stronghold of Frelimo , while the region immediately to the north is , in general , more supportive of Renamo ; The Save separates the ethnic groups that are native speakers of Shangaan ( or Xi - Tsonga ) , to the south , from those that speak languages of the Shona group in the north ; Ecologically , as the Save flows into the Indian Ocean , its mouth corresponds to the separation of tropical marine ecosystems , to the north , from the subtropical ; the terrestrial ecosystems show less variation along the coastal plain north and south of the river , but inland where the Chimanimani mountain range starts , a montane forest develops , which is completely different from the forests found in the south . The delta of the Save River includes mangrove forests which span approximately on the Indian Ocean coast . Villagers in the delta basin use the mangrove forests for timber and as a place for small - scale fishing . The ecology of the lower Save River basin has been affected by cyclones , flooding , erosion , and sea - level rise . Historically it was a transport route for gold and trade goods between the coast and the hinterland occupied by the civilisation of Great Zimbabwe in the 13th and 14th centuries AD .\", 'title': 'Save
